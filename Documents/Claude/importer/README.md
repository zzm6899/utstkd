## Features

- **Cross-platform** — macOS (DMG) and Windows (EXE installer) builds
- **Auto-detect volumes** — Cameras and SD cards detected on mount, DCIM cards sorted first
- **FTP source** — Pull images straight from Wi-Fi cameras or NAS via FTP / FTPS
- **Protected-first ordering** — Files you locked in-camera or flagged read-only appear at the top for fast import
- **Star ratings** — Read EXIF `Rating` / `RatingPercent` and set 0–5 stars with keyboard
- **Quick-cull mode** — Detail view + auto-advance on rate; tear through a shoot in minutes
- **Filters** — Protected / picked / rejected / unrated / duplicates
- **Manifest export** — CSV of every scanned file (rating, pick state, camera, EXIF)
- **EXIF metadata** — Date, camera model, lens, dimensions, ISO / aperture / shutter
- **Folder patterns** — Organize imports by `YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD` or custom patterns
- **Duplicate detection** — Skip files that already exist at the destination
- **Pick / Reject workflow** — Flag keepers and rejects before importing
- **Light & dark themes** — Follows system preference

## Download

**macOS** — download the `.dmg`. macOS will block the first launch; go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

**Windows** — download `PhotoImporter-Setup.exe`. SmartScreen may warn on first run — click **More info → Run anyway**. Portable `.zip` builds are also attached to each release if you'd rather avoid the installer.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

`⌘` on macOS, `Ctrl` on Windows.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Click` | Focus thumbnail |
| `Double-click` | Detail view |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Click` | Toggle select |
| `Shift + Click` | Range select |
| `⌘/Ctrl + A` | Select all |
| `P` / `X` / `U` | Pick / Reject / Clear flag |
| `0` – `5` | Star rating |
| `C` | Toggle quick-cull mode |
| `← → ↑ ↓` | Navigate |
| `Esc` | Deselect / Back |

## FTP source

For cameras and NAS devices that expose an FTP server (Canon EOS / Nikon WT / Sony FTP push, or your own server), switch the source panel to **FTP** and enter:

- Host and port (FTP default 21, FTPS-explicit common on 990)
- User, password
- Remote path (commonly `/DCIM`)

**Test** probes the connection and counts media. **Mirror & Scan** downloads everything under the remote path into a staging directory inside the app's user data folder and runs the normal scan over it — so EXIF, duplicate detection, picks and imports all behave the same as a local card. Re-mirrors are incremental; files already present at the same size are skipped.

## Protected / locked files first

Any file that is read-only at the filesystem level (e.g. you used the camera's in-body "Protect" button, or your card is physically write-locked) is surfaced at the top of the grid with a green **PROTECTED** badge. Pair with the **Protected** filter for a clean keepers-only view.

## GPU Acceleration (Face Recognition)

Face recognition is powered by ONNX Runtime and automatically uses **GPU acceleration** when available, significantly speeding up face detection and embedding across large photo batches.

### How it works

1. On startup, Photo Importer detects your platform and GPU hardware
2. It attempts to load ONNX models using GPU providers in this order:
   - **Windows**: DirectML (GPU-agnostic) → CUDA (NVIDIA) → CPU fallback
   - **macOS**: CoreML (Apple Silicon) → CUDA (external GPU) → CPU fallback
   - **Linux**: CUDA (NVIDIA) → CPU fallback

3. If GPU initialization fails, it transparently falls back to CPU inference
4. Once initialized, you can check GPU status via Developer Tools (inspect `window.electronAPI.isGpuAvailable()`)

### Performance improvement

- **Modern GPU** (NVIDIA RTX 4070, Apple M3, etc.): **0.1–0.5s per photo** (30–50× faster than CPU)
- **Old GPU / CPU only** (Intel i7-11th gen): **20–30s per photo**
- **Modern CPU** (AMD Ryzen 7900X3D): **1s per photo**

GPU acceleration is most beneficial on:
- **Batches of 100+ photos** — initialization overhead is amortized
- **RAW + JPEG pairs** — GPU processes face embeddings in parallel much faster than CPU
- **Burst sequences** — multi-face detection across high-speed bursts runs in seconds instead of minutes

### Installation / configuration

**GPU support requires onnxruntime with GPU bindings.** By default, `onnxruntime-node` ships with CPU support only.

#### NVIDIA CUDA (Windows / Linux / macOS)

To enable CUDA support:

1. Install [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (v12.x recommended)
2. Install [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (v9.x for CUDA 12)
3. Verify by checking `$env:CUDA_PATH` (Windows) or `which nvcc` (Linux/macOS)
4. When you rebuild/run the app, it will auto-detect and use CUDA

#### DirectML (Windows only)

DirectML is built into Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022 and works with any GPU (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA). No additional setup required — just run the app on Windows 10/11 and GPU acceleration activates automatically.

#### CoreML (macOS Apple Silicon only)

No setup needed — CoreML is native on M-series Macs and automatically used.

### Troubleshooting GPU issues

- **"GPU acceleration unavailable, falling back to CPU"** — Your system doesn't have a compatible GPU runtime, or CUDA/cuDNN is not properly installed. Check the console logs.
- **App is slow (face analysis takes 20+ sec/photo)** — Likely CPU-only. Verify GPU detection: open DevTools (F12) and run `window.electronAPI.isGpuAvailable()`. Returns `true` = GPU active, `false` = CPU only, `null` = not yet run.
- **CUDA errors on Linux/macOS** — Verify `nvidia-smi` shows your GPU. If not, CUDA is not installed or detected.

## Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zzm6899/autophotoimporter.git
cd importer
npm ci
npm start            # dev mode (whichever OS you run it on)
npm run make         # build installers for the host platform
```

Requires **Node 20+**.

- On **macOS** `npm run make` produces a `.dmg` and a `.zip` under `out/make/`.
- On **Windows** it produces `PhotoImporter-Setup.exe` (Squirrel), a `.nupkg`, and a portable `.zip` under `out/make/`.

### Windows one-shot setup

Prefer clicking over typing? Double-click `scripts\setup-windows.cmd` (or run it from a Command Prompt in the repo root). It verifies Node 20+, installs dependencies, and shows a menu for dev / build / install-only. You can also pass the action directly:

```cmd
scripts\setup-windows.cmd dev      :: install + npm start (dev mode)
scripts\setup-windows.cmd build    :: install + npm run make (produces PhotoImporter-Setup.exe)
scripts\setup-windows.cmd install  :: install deps only
```

The GitHub Actions workflow now builds release artifacts from version tags. From Windows CMD or PowerShell:

```cmd
git tag v1.1.6
git push origin v1.1.6
```

That tag triggers GitHub Actions to build both macOS and Windows. If the TrueNAS publish secrets are configured, the workflow also mirrors the public artifacts into the hosted update feed automatically.

## License keys

The app now supports signed offline license keys.

Windows shortcut: run `scripts\license-tools.cmd` for an interactive console menu.

You can also use the Node console directly:

```bash
npm run license:console -- status
npm run license:console -- keypair
npm run license:console -- create --name "Customer Name" --expiry 31-12-2027 --tier "Full access"
npm run license:console -- build
```

1. Run `npm run license:keypair` once on your machine. This creates:
   `scripts/license-keys/private.pem`
   `scripts/license-keys/public.pem`
   and updates `src/shared/license-public-key.ts`
2. Keep `scripts/license-keys/private.pem` secret.
3. Generate a customer key with:

```bash
npm run license:generate -- --name "Customer Name" --email "customer@example.com" --expiry 31-12-2027 --tier "Full access"
```

Paste the generated key into the app's **Settings → License** section to activate it.

Important: existing EXEs will continue to accept newly generated customer licenses as long as you keep using the same `private.pem`. If you replace the keypair, you must ship a new app build with the new public key.

Without a valid license, the app stays in browse/review mode and importing is blocked.

## Architecture notes

- **Electron + Vite + React 19** (HTML renderer, so the same UI ships to every OS)
- Platform-specific services are isolated to `src/main/services/*`:
  - `volume-watcher.ts` — `/Volumes` watcher on macOS, PowerShell / `Win32_LogicalDisk` polling on Windows, `/media` + `/run/media` on Linux
  - `exif-parser.ts` — `exifr` everywhere; thumbnail fallback uses `sips` (macOS), `System.Drawing` via PowerShell (Windows), `convert` (Linux)
  - `import-engine.ts` — same platform split for in-flight format conversion
  - `ftp-source.ts` — `basic-ftp` client that mirrors into a staging directory

# Hosted Updates

For the TrueNAS-hosted update/admin stack:

1. Clone this repo onto the TrueNAS server.
2. Copy `.env.truenas.example` to `.env` and fill in real secrets.
3. Start from repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Public endpoints:

- `https://admin.culler.z2hs.au`
- `https://updates.culler.z2hs.au`

If you prefer the TrueNAS Apps UI instead of shell-driven `docker compose`, use:

- [deploy/truenas/custom-app.yaml](/C:/Users/24681/Documents/Claude/importer/deploy/truenas/custom-app.yaml)

The hosted admin image is published from the private GitHub repo to:

- `ghcr.io/zzm6899/photo-importer-update-admin:latest`

Artifacts are served from the repo-root `artifacts/` directory through Caddy at:

- `https://updates.culler.z2hs.au/artifacts/...`

Optional private-GitHub sync for the admin panel:

- `GITHUB_RELEASE_OWNER`
- `GITHUB_RELEASE_REPO`
- `GITHUB_RELEASE_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to `https://api.github.com`)

Local/manual release registration:

```powershell
$env:UPDATE_ADMIN_API_TOKEN="your-admin-api-token"
npm run update:publish -- --endpoint https://updates.culler.z2hs.au --platform windows --version 1.1.11 --file .\out\make\squirrel.windows\x64\PhotoImporter-Setup.exe --release-name "Photo Importer 1.1.11" --release-url https://admin.culler.z2hs.au/releases/1.1.11 --notes "Manual release import" --rollout live
```

That helper uploads the installer to the hosted admin/update service and registers the release record there. GitHub Actions does the same thing automatically once `UPDATE_ADMIN_ENDPOINT` and `UPDATE_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` are configured as repo secrets.

If the hosted admin container has both `public.pem` and `private.pem` mounted, the Licenses page can also generate customer license keys directly in the web UI.
